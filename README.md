# HR-Analytics
This project aims to empower the HR team at AtliQ with valuable insights into employee behaviour and preferences, ultimately enhancing productivity. 
Through the implementation of a comprehensive dashboard, we will gain a deeper understanding of important terminologies such asWFH (Work from Home), 
SL Count (Sick Leave Count),P (Present), HP (Half Pay Leave),PL (Pay Leave),WO (Weekly Off), and HO (Holiday Off).

By leveraging these insights, the HR team can tailor their strategies and initiatives to create an environment that maximizes employee engagement and productivity.
- Created Dax measure to calculate the percentage of work-from-home (WFH) count. This measure provides insights into the proportion of employees opting for remote work arrangements. 
Created DAX measure to calculate the percentage of employee presence. This measure will help in determining the proportion of employees who are currently present in the workplace.

By utilizing this measure,AtliQ can gain valuable insights into the attendance patterns within organization, enabling them to analyse workforce dynamics and make informed decisions
-Created a DAX measure to calculate the percentage of sick leave count. This measure will enable to understand the proportion of employees taking sick leave in relation to the total
workforce. By utilizing this measure, we can gain insights into absenteeism trends, which can help us identify patterns, address potential issues, and implement strategies to support
  employee well-being.
